# 2-flavor-solar-neutrino-oscillation
This Python code calculates and visualizes the flavor evolution of solar neutrinos  as they travel from the Sun to Earth.  It uses a 2-flavor neutrino model with vacuum and matter effects, based on the BP2000  solar electron density model.


Main Features:
- Compute the neutrino Hamiltonian including vacuum oscillations and matter potential.
- Solve the Schrödinger equation for neutrino flavor evolution.
- Calculate flavor probabilities P(ν_e) and P(ν_μ) at user-specified distances.
- Plot the survival and transition probabilities versus distance.

Usage:
- Adjust the neutrino energy (E_nu) and evaluation points (r_eval) as needed.
- Ensure the BP2000 electron density model file is available.
- Run the script to obtain probability curves and visualize the results.
